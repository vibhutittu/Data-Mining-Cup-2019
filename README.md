## Fraud detection at self-checkouts in retail

The number of self-checkout stations is on the rise. This includes stationary self-checkouts, where customers take their shopping cart to a scan station and pay for their products. Secondly, there are semi-stationary self-checkouts, where customers scan their products directly and only pay at a counter. The customers either use their own smartphone for scanning or the store provides mobile scanners. You will probably have encountered this already.
This automated process helps avoid long lines and speeds up the paying process for individual customers. But how can retailers prevent the trust they have placed in customers from being abused? How can they decide which purchases to check in an effort to expose fraudsters without annoying innocent customers?
